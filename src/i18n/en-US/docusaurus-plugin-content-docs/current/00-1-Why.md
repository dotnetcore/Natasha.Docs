## Knowledge reserve

Up to now, there are still many people asking what dynamic compilation is, what scenes Emit is used in, how to use the expression tree, it is recommended that if you do not know the students first to find information to learn, such as[food article](https://www.cnblogs.com/whuanle/category/1548012.html).

## Contemporary pillars

Dynamic compilation is one of the key pillars supporting the contemporary .NET ecosystem, and this technology "serves" a variety of official and unofficial libraries.The core of dynamic compilation is MSIL, and writing IL code officially provides Emit technology, but writing and maintaining Emit is painful, such as syntax sugar reduction, asynchronous methods, instruction compatibility, large amounts of metadata manipulation, error debugging, dynamic automata, dynamic building of complex businesses, and so on. I'm afraid only the author of the open source project knows the expression.

Since this thing is so important, why not wrap it up?Officials offer a relatively human expression tree, but this only improves the ease of writing, but introduces new things, such as expression tree-based configuration and parsing.

## The way to solve it

The emergence of Roslyn gave me hope of an eco-flowering that made Emit transparent and allowed us to compile dynamically using C# code.This is Wang Dao, brothers, this is the new era of the great color of the way ah.This scheme is tantamount to a bird gun for a gun, some people may care more about the official attitude, it can be said that the official is recommended to do so, but you can not control the problem, the cost of this technology is reference dependency, error handling, domain loading and other issues.After a series of research, collation, and testing, Natasha has addressed these issues and is officially available to the public in 2019, and now Natasha has released a stable version in the netcore/net5 release, and over the course of the past two years, we have gone from integration to decoupling, from mid-term to new technology applications, natasha is taking a light route from no-> -> -> -> .Next I'll go into more detail about Natasha's application in conjunction with the sample.

## Project first knowledge

Natasha uses the MIT open source protocol and has been tested in practice, using Natasha by referencing DotNetCore.Natasha.CSharp.All.

Natasha's most basic compilation unit is AssemblyCSharpBuilder, which has many properties:

- CompileErorBehavior compiles the wrong behavior, defaulting to throwing an exception;
- The behavior of SyntaxError Behavior syntax errors, which defaults to throwing exceptions;
- AssemblyOutputKind assembly output to file or memory stream;
- OutputFold assembly output directory, default to dynamicLibraryFolds directory under current APP;
- CustomUsingShut uses a customer-defined using reference;

Build a Test class in a random domain

```cs
Initialize Natasha compilation components and environments
NatashaInitializer.Initialize();
// Create a compilation unit and specify the assembly name
AssemblyCSharpBuilder oop , new AssemblyCSharpBuilder ("myAssembly");
//compilation unit uses random domains assigned from domain management
oop. Domain = DomainManagement.Random;
// Add code to the compilation unit
oop. Add(@"namespace HelloWorld{ public class Test{ public Test(){ Name = null; } public string Name; }  }");
// Gets classes in an assembly by short name, long names such as "HelloWorld.Test"
Type type . . . oop. GetTypeFromShortName("Test");
above shows the construction of strings, natasha provides a number of templates to simplify operations such as NClass, which can be converted to:
var type s NClass
. RandomDomain()
. Namespace("HelloWorld")
. Name("Test")
. Ctor(item => item. Public(). Body("Name = null;" ))
. PublicField<string>("Name")
. GetType();
```

It is important to note that this assembly belongs to a local domain, and you can use type. DisposeDomain() to remove the reference so that the GC can uninstall it. The main domain (the domain where the program started) is also called the shared domain, the random domain can get the type and data in the main domain, the call between random domains is not allowed, this feature also lets the later plug-in programming greatly.

## Simple scenario

By this point we learned how to build classes using Natasha, we can try to accomplish some simple scenarios ourselves, such as implementing an AOP proxy class, and if you have enough knowledge of the AOP proxy class, I believe 5 minutes can be small.

Examples have been written before for reference. Contoller can also be built dynamically to implement dynamic API functionality, but this requires MVC/WebAPI-related knowledge. Alternatively, you can combine CodeFirst-enabled ORMs such as FreeSql to create a table structure when the program is initialized, and some corporate entities require low intrusiveness, or even 0 intrusiveness, where you can use Natasha to build temporary classes with label intrusions instead of entity classes to accomplish some functionality.

Natasha is a real dynamic real-world project, the examples listed above all need to have a certain programming foundation, if there is no need and thinking advice not to move hard sets.

## plan

This article reveals the tip of Natasha's iceberg, and we'll explore more technology and applications.

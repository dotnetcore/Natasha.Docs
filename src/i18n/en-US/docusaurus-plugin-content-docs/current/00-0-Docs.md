[![Member project of .NET Core Community](https://img.shields.io/badge/member%20project%20of-NCC-9e20c9.svg)](https://github.com/dotnetcore) [![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/link-996.icu-red.svg)](https://996.icu/#/zh_CN) [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/dotnetcore/natasha.svg)](https://github.com/dotnetcore/Natasha/blob/master/LICENSE)

A library of C-dynamic assemblies based on [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) that allows developers to build domains/assemblies/classes/structures/enumeration/interfaces/methods, etc. at runtime, allowing the program to add new modules and features while running.Natasha integrates domain management/plug-in management for domain isolation, domain offloading, hot-swapping and more. The library follows a complete compilation process, provides complete error tips, automatically adds references, and a well-developed data structure building template that allows developers to focus only on assembly scripting, compatible with netcoreapp2.0 plus / netcoreapp3.0 plus, cross-platform, unified, simple chain API. And we will fix your problem and reply to your [](https://github.com/dotnetcore/Natasha/issues/new)as soon as possible .

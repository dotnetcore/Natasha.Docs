A library of C-dynamic assembly buildings based on [Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) , which allows developers to add assemblies to running programs by using the dynamic build domain/assembly/class/structure/enumeration/interface/method, etc. of the C? code dynamically in the run of the program.Natasha integrates domain management/plug-in management for domain isolation, domain offloading, hot-swapping and more. The library follows a complete compilation process, provides complete error tips, automatically adds references, and a well-developed data structure building template that allows developers to focus only on assembly scripting, compatible with netcoreapp2.0 plus / netcoreapp3.0 plus, providing a cross-platform, unified, simple chain API. And we will fix your problem and reply to your [](https://github.com/dotnetcore/Natasha/issues/new)as soon as possible .

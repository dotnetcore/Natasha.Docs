title: "Mild package 1"

The layer operation class is encapsulated on Builder, the most flexible, and users can also wrap the Builder class, which includes templates and abstract compilers, template-generated strings, compiled by the compiler, and returned. That's all, it's not hard to understand.

This package is divided into 2 categoriesï¼š

- Template customization method, using Natasha to provide linQ operation class custom template.
- Metadata customization method, first reflecting out MethodInfo, and then copying a template.

On the basis of the metadata customization method is the operation class implementation of the delegate, because the delegate can directly utilize the metadata generation method. The delegate implementation is followed by an extension implementation of the string, which can be combined individually with the delegate and generated by the method.

## vNext

 - ##### 2021/12/03

   - Fix bugs compiled by XML comments, support XML comment file generation.

   - The Natasha compilation unit adds the SetDllFilePath/SetPdbFilePath/SetXmlFilePath method so that developers can create corresponding files on demand.

   - Natasha compilation unit removes AssemblyBuildKind enumeration, compilation output files controlled by developers.

   - The empty reference switch for the Natasha compilation unit is turned off by default, and it is recommended to turn it on manually in the case of manual string compilation.

 - ##### 2021/11/26

   - Optimize plug-in loading methods, add "blacklist" dependencies, control plug-in dependencies loading.

 - ##### 2021/11/16

   - Perfect UT testing, increase the principal agent to try to solve the problem of empty reference delivery failure.

   - Adjust the reflection logic of some APIs.

 - ##### 2021/11/15

   - The compiler adds an empty reference option switch, and adds AssemblyCSharpBuilder extension method EnableNullableCompile/DisableNullableCompile.

   - Add an empty reference template.

 - ##### 2021/11/12

   - graft. NET6.0 empty type member reflection API to NETCOREAPP 3.1 and NET5.0 runtime.

   - Add complex available reference UT tests.

   - Adding members can be empty type anti-solution, and event/field/attribute/argument can be reversed.

 - ##### 2021/11/10

   - Turn on empty references, refactor Natasha, and override part of the exception handling logic.

   - Upgrade Natasha's dependency environment `DotNetCore.SourceLink.Environment` and `DotNetCore.Compile.Environment`.

   - Transform Natasha's msbuild build.

   - Upgrade dependencies and target frameworks to increase . NET6.0 support.

   - Upgrade dependency to increase support for the C#10 syntax.

 - ##### 2021/11/09

   - Project removes support for the following versions of core3.1.

   - Accelerate initialization warm-up.

   - Upgrade `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyModel` to version 6.0.

   - Core3.1 is compatible with skipLocalsInit Attribute property.

   - The addition of the SupportSkipLocalInit method to the Natasha C# compiler to be compatible with the `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyModel` version 6.0 raises the issue of ambiguity references.

   - Compiler template add API : ConfigComplier allows developers to configure compilers.

   - Compiler template variation API : ConfigCompilation allows developers to configure compiler options.

   - Update the compilation binding identity.

## v3.6.0.0

 - ##### 2021/11/08

   - Remove some useless code and merge items.

   - Project removes support for the following versions of core3.1.

   - Accelerate initialization warm-up.

   - Add the parameters of the plug-in loading method, allowing the user to choose whether to load the full dependency reference. This parameter affects whether interfaces and abstract classes are defined in the primary domain when the plug-in is loaded into a non-primary domain.

   - Replace the syntax tree format API.

   - Supports the method of dynamically recording success logs, not logged by default, NDelegate/Nxx/. RandomDomain(item=>item. Disable/EnableSucceedLog()).

   - Log directory replaced by /log/to /NatashaLogs/

## v3.5.0.0

 - ##### 2021/09/07

   - Source code increases time-consuming echo in DEBUG mode.

   - Fix an error in the warm-up function that refers to initialization.

   - The latest version is archived in the Achive31 branch.

## v3.4.0.0

 - ##### 2021/08/16

   - DomainManagement optimizes initialization exception tips.

   - The antisyser repairs the anti-solution of the empty paradigm type.

   - Project archive to the Achive31 branch, future versions will start with core3.1 compatible.

## v3.1.0.0

 - ##### 2021/07/14

    - Restore supports versions above standard 2.0 and core2.0.

    - Optimize the plug-in reference management scheme of the DomainBase class, further unify reference management, and remove unnecessary exposure methods.

    - Optimize the implementation of Natasha AssemblyDomain, add the core3.0- version of dependency anti-solution, plug-in behavior is the same:

      - Core3.0 , which parses json files and loads assemblies, supports plug-ins that rely on file version overlays, and upgrades plug-in principals.

      - core3.0 - Scan only dll in the same directory and load assemblies, and cannot upgrade plug-in dependencies.

    - Optimize compilation processes and event calls.

    - Optimize the namespace deinterslating process, masking ExportEdTypes from exporting and throwing exceptions.

    - Optimize template class API naming and classification, distinguishing Set from Append operations.

    - Add named control content append templates, allowing developers to append code to the same namespace.

    - Increase the Syntax node of the Record data type to get the API automatically.

    - Rename the underlying class fields and events.

    - The Natasha.CSharp.Extension.InvisibleInstance extension complements the call chain with CS0103 errors.

<br/>

## v3.0.0.0

- ##### 2021/06/25

  - Refactoring the engine, adding semantic analysis APIs, user-writeable semantic parsing extensions, thanks to the powerful semantic analyzer, we have upgraded and refactored the compilation engine.

  - Built-in CS0246/CS0234 semantic analysis processor.

  - Removing CS0104 to `Natasha.CSharp.Extension.Ambiguity` extension package, we believe that ambiguous references should not become a common problem.

  - Added CS8019 useless using processing, thin generated code, post-processing script using for on-demand reference, what using script is required to automatically render what using.

  - Change the passer domain in the NDelegate action class to pass compiler, add the AddUsing API, although you may never use it.

  - Remove the standard2.0 support, change to netcoreapp2.0/2.1/2.2 specific version support.

  - Opened netcore2.1/2.2 version of anti-solution support for readonly / ref structures.

  - Release `Natasha.CSharp.Extension.InvisibleInstance` extension package, eliminating reference calls to the first parameter of the method in the script, such as: arg. Show can be written directly as Show.

<br/>

## v2.1.0.0

- ##### 2021/05/09

  - Optimize the engine, streamline the compilation process, remove infrequent events.

  - Domain additions `AddReferenceFrom (Type/Type<T>/Assembly)` 3 referenced APIs.

  - Anti-solver adds extension method:

    - GetDevelopNameWithoutFlag Gets Unmarked Type Name: `System.Collections.Generic.List<>`
    - GetDevelopName Get Full Type Name: `System.Collections.Generic.List<T>`
    - GetRuntimeName Gets Runtime Class Name: `List<int>`

  - Add strong names to compile.

  - Standardize file structure and secondary class naming.

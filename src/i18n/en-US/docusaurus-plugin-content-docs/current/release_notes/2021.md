## v3.4.0.0

 - ##### 2021/08/16

   - DomainManagement optimizes initialization exception tips.

   - The antisyser repairs the anti-solution of the empty paradigm type.

   - Project archive to the Achive31 branch, future versions will start with core3.1 compatible.

## v3.1.0.0

 - ##### 2021/07/14

    - Restore supports versions above standard 2.0 and core2.0.

    - Optimize the plug-in reference management scheme of the DomainBase class, further unify reference management, and remove unnecessary exposure methods.

    - Optimize the implementation of Natasha AssemblyDomain, add the core3.0- version of dependency anti-solution, plug-in behavior is the same:

      - Core3.0 , which parses json files and loads assemblies, supports plug-ins that rely on file version overlays, and upgrades plug-in principals.

      - core3.0 - Scan only dll in the same directory and load assemblies, and cannot upgrade plug-in dependencies.

    - Optimize compilation processes and event calls.

    - Optimize the namespace deinterslating process, masking ExportEdTypes from exporting and throwing exceptions.

    - Optimize template class API naming and classification, distinguishing Set from Append operations.

    - Add named control content append templates, allowing developers to append code to the same namespace.

    - Increase the Syntax node of the Record data type to get the API automatically.

    - Rename the underlying class fields and events.

    - The Natasha.CSharp.Extension.InvisibleInstance extension complements the call chain with CS0103 errors.

## v3.0.0.0

- ##### 2021/06/25

  - Refactoring the engine, adding semantic analysis APIs, user-writeable semantic parsing extensions, thanks to the powerful semantic analyzer, we have upgraded and refactored the compilation engine.

  - Built-in CS0246/CS0234 semantic analysis processor.

  - Removing CS0104 to `Natasha.CSharp.Extension.Ambiguity` extension package, we believe that ambiguous references should not become a common problem.

  - Added CS8019 useless using processing, thin generated code, post-processing script using for on-demand reference, what using script is required to automatically render what using.

  - Change the passer domain in the NDelegate action class to pass compiler, add the AddUsing API, although you may never use it.

  - Remove the standard2.0 support, change to netcoreapp2.0/2.1/2.2 specific version support.

  - Opened netcore2.1/2.2 version of anti-solution support for readonly / ref structures.

  - Release `Natasha.CSharp.Extension.InvisibleInstance` extension package, eliminating reference calls to the first parameter of the method in the script, such as: arg. Show can be written directly as Show.

<br/>

## v2.1.0.0

- ##### 2021/05/09

  - Optimize the engine, streamline the compilation process, remove infrequent events.

  - Domain additions `AddReferenceFrom (Type/Type<T>/Assembly)` 3 referenced APIs.

  - Anti-solver adds extension method:

    - GetDevelopNameWithoutFlag Gets Unmarked Type Name: `System.Collections.Generic.List<>`
    - GetDevelopName Get Full Type Name: `System.Collections.Generic.List<T>`
    - GetRuntimeName Gets Runtime Class Name: `List<int>`

  - Add strong names to compile.

  - Standardize file structure and secondary class naming.
